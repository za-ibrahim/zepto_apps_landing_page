        Our Story
      </h1>
      <div class="flex flex-col items-start gap-8">
        <p>
          Our journey began in 2016 with a simple but powerful vision: to solve
          a core gap on Shopify—the absence of a truly great app for live
          product customization. Many tools existed, but none delivered the
          seamless, intuitive experience merchants and their customers deserved.
        </p>
        <p>
          We founded our company to deliver not just a tool, but the best
          possible experience for both merchants and shoppers. That commitment
          to excellence has guided every decision since.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the way, we discovered more opportunities to help merchants
          grow. Building on the success of our flagship product, we expanded our
          portfolio with additional apps—each created to simplify, enhance, and
          accelerate eCommerce for stores of all sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          As our mission grew, so did the community around it. From our first
          users to today, over 110K+ merchants have chosen our apps to power
          their stores. We now proudly support an active community of 13K+
          businesses across 100+ countries, each finding new ways to thrive with
          our solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our story is still being written—and with every innovation, we remain
          dedicated to making eCommerce simpler, stronger, and more successful
          for merchants everywhere.
